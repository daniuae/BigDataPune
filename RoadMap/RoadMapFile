 DATA ENGINEER ROADMAP: SQL → Spark → Scala

🟦 PHASE 1 — MASTER SQL (2–4 weeks)
SQL is the foundation of all data engineering.
✅ 1. SQL Basics
SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY
LIMIT, DISTINCT
Basic filters
Arithmetic & logical operators
Practice:
Write queries on real tables: employees, orders, customers.

✅ 2. Joins
INNER
LEFT / RIGHT
FULL
CROSS
Self join
Goal: Explain and visualize join outputs in interviews.

✅ 3. Grouping & Aggregations
GROUP BY
HAVING
COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX

✅ 4. Advanced SQL
Window Functions
CTEs
Subqueries
Date/Time functions
CASE WHEN
COALESCE, NULL handling

✔ Deliverables:
Write 40+ complex SQL queries
Solve LeetCode Data SQL problems
Implement 5 SQL-based ETL pipelines

🟧 PHASE 2 — SPARK FOUNDATIONS (3–5 weeks)

🔹 1. Spark Basics
Learn:
Spark architecture
Driver & Executors
Transformations vs Actions
Lazy evaluation
DAG

🔹 2. Spark with DataFrames (Main skill required for real jobs)
Must learn:
Reading/Writing files
Select, filter, cast
groupBy, agg
joins
union, limit
withColumn, drop, rename
These are used in every ETL job.

🔹 3. Spark SQL
Creating temporary views
Writing SQL on Spark
UDFs
Built-in functions

🔹 4. Intermediate Spark
Repartition vs Coalesce
Cache vs Persist
Shuffle, skew
Broadcast join
Window functions in Spark

🔹 5. Advanced Spark
Spark on AWS EMR
Partitioning, Bucketing
Optimizing cluster usage
Spark UI & performance tuning
Catalyst optimizer
Stages & tasks breakdown

🔹 6. Project to build
ETL Pipeline:
Read JSON from S3
Clean data
Apply business logic
Write to Parquet
Register Delta table

🟩 PHASE 3 — SCALA FOR DATA ENGINEERS (3–6 weeks)
Learn only the Scala required for Spark (not advanced FP unless needed).

🔹 1. Essential Scala Syntax
Variables, types
Functions
Loops, conditionals
Collections (List, Seq, Map)
Tuples
Options (Some / None)

🔹 2. Scala OOP Basics
Classes
Objects
Case classes
Companion objects

🔹 3. Functional Programming (Only DE essentials)
map
flatMap
filter
reduce
fold
Anonymous functions
Know enough to write clean Spark code.

🔹 4. Error Handling
Try / Success / Failure
Either
Pattern matching

🔹 5. Scala + Spark Integration
Learn writing:
UDFs
case class-based schemas
Datasets
Example:
case class Person(id: Int, name: String)
val ds = df.as[Person]


🟦 PHASE 4 — END-TO-END PROJECTS (4–6 weeks)
Do 3–5 fully working projects.

 1. Batch ETL Project
Read CSV
Validate schema
Clean data
Window functions
Agg logic
Write to Delta

 2. S3 → EMR ETL Pipeline
Triggered by S3 upload
Spark job on EMR
Output to Redshift

 3. Data Quality Framework
Write Spark-based DQ checks:
null checks
uniqueness checks
referential checks
regex validation

 4. Real-time pipeline (Optional but good)
Kafka → Spark Structured Streaming → Delta → Dashboard

🟥 PHASE 5 — TOOLING & ECOSYSTEM (Parallel Learning)
Learn tools alongside Spark/Scala.
Must-learn tools:
Git
IntelliJ
sbt
Maven (optional)
Linux + Shell
AWS (S3, EMR, Lambda, Glue, Athena, Redshift)
Databricks

⭐ Recommended Weekly Plan (Fast Track)
Week 1–2 → SQL
Week 3–4 → Scala Basics
Week 5–8 → Spark Core + Spark SQL + ETL
Week 9–12 → Projects + AWS + performance tuning
